####This is a small bash function that can be useful if you want to find all your container's ip addresses.

***Instructions:*** 

1) Add this function to your ```~/.bashrc```, ```~/.bash_profile``` or ```~/.profile```;

2) run ```source ~/.bashrc```, ```source ~/.bash_profile``` or ```source ~/.profile``` to apply your changes;

3) run ```docker-ip``` to list ip-addresses of all your containers.

***Example:***
```
# docker-ip
IP ADDRESS       CONTAINER ID      IMAGE      COMMAND      CREATED            STATUS            PORTS     NAMES
